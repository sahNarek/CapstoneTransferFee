# Analyzing Soccer's Transfers and predicting Footballers' transfer price.
This is a Capstone project done during the bachelor degree study at the American University of Armenia.<br/>
The project delivers a way of analyzing the economic market of soccer and predicting the transfer fee of soccer players.<br/>
The data was scrapped from [transfermarkt](https://www.transfermarkt.com/) and [sofifa](https://sofifa.com/).<br/>
The code for scrapping can be found [here](https://github.com/ashotkhanaslanyan/Capstone). <br/>
The data is stored in .zip format in this repository. <br/>
The analysis stage contains three approaches.

* Exploratory Analysis
* Time Series Analysis
* Network Analysis

The modeling stage contains two approaches.

* Machine Learning Algorithms
* Neural Networks Regression

As an end-product, the visualizations are deployed on an interactive dashboard. <br/>
The code for the dashboard can be found [here](https://github.com/ashotkhanaslanyan/cs2020capstonedashboard). <br/>
The link for the deployed dashboard can be found [here](https://sportstatdash.herokuapp.com/). <br/>

*Google Colab was used for development, so please change the path to Capstone/ folder when using another IDE.
